# machine-learning-training
This is a personal place to train machine learning and develop my skills in IA. I'll document everything that I'm doing or plan to do in the future.

I was already taking some classes by myself, but I've decided to organize everything in one place, as it could help others to engage in the same path and avoid some mistakes that I've done. That said, I'm just a begginer, a rookie, so this probably won't be the best practice code example, but I'd love to get feedback that help me to get better.
