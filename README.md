# machine-learning-training
This is a personal place to train machine learning and develop my skills in IA.

I've decided to organize everything in one place, as it could help others to engage in the same path and avoid some mistakes that I've done. That said, I'm just a begginer, so this probably won't be the best practice code example, but I'd love to get feedback that help me to get better.

1. Generic image classifier using Keras
2. Stock prediction using machine learning regression
3. Very simple classifier
4. Very simple classifier 2 (a little bit better)
